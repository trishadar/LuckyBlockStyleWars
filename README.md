# :high_heel: Lucky Block Style Wars :sandal:
## Description
Have you ever wanted to experience the thrill of unpredictable fashion battles where each round brings random and unique clothing pieces to style your avatar? In Lucky Block Style Wars, programmed in Roblox Studio using Lua, players open Lucky Blocks containing random fashion items and must create outfits to compete in a series of style battles. Each round has a different theme or challenge, and the last player standing wins.
## Motivation
As a Roblox player, I find dress up games really enjoyable because they encourage friendly competition and creativity. However, most of the dress up games available on Roblox are very similar and do not have a random element to it when it comes to clothing options. This can make the rounds feel repetitive, so I decided to implement lucky blocks into a dress up game. Lucky blocks are blocks that spawn completely random fahsion pieces when broken with different levels of luck (lucky, super lucky, unlucky). I hope this game will bring more excitement to the Roblox gamer community.
